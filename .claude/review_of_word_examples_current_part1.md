## Review Summary
**Date**: 2025-08-10
**Scope**: Rows 1-2000 of word_examples.csv (2000 entries reviewed)
**Quality Status**: Mostly clean after recent cleanup work

## Issues Found

### 1. ÂìÅË©ûÁ¢∫Ë™ç (Part of Speech Issues)

**Row 11**: `absurd`
- **Original**: "The play descended into an absurd."
- **Problem**: 'absurd' used as noun, but the example feels incomplete/unnatural
- **Fix**: "The play descended into absurd comedy that made no logical sense."
- **Meaning**: "Nonsense; something unreasonable or illogical" - noun usage is valid

**Row 91**: `all`  
- **Original**: "She gave her all to the project."
- **Problem**: While 'all' can be a noun (meaning "everything"), this usage is more idiomatic than clear noun usage
- **Fix**: "The all of her effort was evident in the final result." (though this sounds awkward)
- **Alternative**: "She gave everything to the project." (though this changes the target word)
- **Note**: This is a borderline case - current usage may be acceptable

**Row 115**: `american`
- **Original**: "The American is known for his generosity."
- **Problem**: None - this is correct noun usage (person from America)
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Correct

**Row 188**: `aquatic`
- **Original**: "A water lily is a type of aquatic."
- **Problem**: 'aquatic' used as noun but feels incomplete
- **Fix**: "A water lily is a type of aquatic plant that flourishes in ponds."
- **Note**: The meaning suggests it should be "water organism" but example doesn't specify organism

**Row 572**: `but`
- **Original**: "There are no ifs, ands, or buts about it; you must finish the project."
- **Problem**: This is correct noun usage in the phrase "no ifs, ands, or buts"
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Correct

### 2. ÂçòÊï∞ÂΩ¢ÂæπÂ∫ï (Singular Form Issues)

**Row 1134**: `dead`
- **Original**: "The dead of night is the quietest time."
- **Problem**: None - "dead" here is used as singular noun (the dead = the quiet/stillness)
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Correct

### 3. ÂìÅË≥™Âü∫Ê∫ñ (Quality Issues)

**Row 230**: `ass`
- **Original**: "The stubborn ass refused to move despite all encouragement."
- **Problem**: While technically correct (ass = donkey), this word has crude slang meaning that might be inappropriate for learning material
- **Recommendation**: Consider if this entry should be kept, replaced, or marked with content warning
- **Status**: üî∂ Content concern

**Row 559**: `bum`
- **Original**: "Lazy bum avoided work responsibilities constantly."
- **Problem**: While 'bum' can mean buttocks or homeless person, using it as "lazy bum" could be considered inappropriate/offensive
- **Fix**: "The vagrant lived as a bum on city streets." (more neutral)
- **Status**: üî∂ Content concern

**Row 574**: `butt`
- **Original**: "Cigarette butt littered public sidewalk carelessly."
- **Problem**: While cigarette butt is appropriate, the word 'butt' has crude meanings
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Acceptable in this context (cigarette butt is standard term)
