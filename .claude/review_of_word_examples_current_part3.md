**Quality Status**: Excellent - Extremely clean after recent comprehensive cleanup

## Issues Found

### 1. ÂìÅË©ûÁ¢∫Ë™ç (Part of Speech Issues)

**Row 4044**: `particular`
- **Original**: "The lawyer noted a particular in the contract."
- **Problem**: While 'particular' can be used as noun meaning "a specific detail," this usage sounds awkward
- **Meaning**: "A specific detail or item"
- **Fix**: "The lawyer noted a particular detail in the contract terms." (but this changes the word)
- **Alternative**: "The particular mentioned in the contract was crucial." (better noun usage)

**Row 4089**: `positive`
- **Original**: "The test result was a false positive."
- **Problem**: This is correct noun usage - "positive" as medical test result
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Correct

**Row 4136**: `re`
- **Original**: "Musical note re follows do in major scale progression."
- **Problem**: This is correct noun usage - "re" as musical note name
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Correct

**Row 4161**: `right`
- **Original**: "Constitutional right protects freedom of speech and assembly."
- **Problem**: This is correct noun usage - "right" as entitlement/legal right
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Correct

**Row 4402**: `like`
- **Original**: "Social media like indicates approval of posted content."
- **Problem**: This is correct modern noun usage - "like" as social media approval indicator
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Correct

**Row 4454**: `out`
- **Original**: "Emergency out provided safe evacuation during the building fire."
- **Problem**: While 'out' can be used as noun meaning "way of escape," this sounds awkward
- **Fix**: "Emergency exit provided safe evacuation during the building fire." (but changes target word)
- **Alternative**: "The out was clearly marked for emergency situations."

### 2. ÊñáÊ≥ï„ÉªËá™ÁÑ∂ÊÄß (Grammar and Naturalness)

**Row 4036**: `pants`
- **Original**: "Waterproof pants protected hikers during rainy mountain expeditions."
- **Problem**: 'Pants' is plurale tantum (always plural) but CSV shows singular 'pant' in meaning
- **Status**: üî∂ Special handling - plurale tantum word

**Row 4467**: `pale`
- **Original**: "Wooden pale marked the property boundary between neighboring farms."
- **Problem**: Correct but archaic usage - 'pale' meaning boundary post/stake
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Correct but uncommon

**Row 4580**: `seventy`
- **Original**: "The number seventy is ten times seven."
- **Problem**: Redundant definition - example restates the meaning mathematically
- **Fix**: "Grandfather celebrated his seventieth birthday with family."

### 3. ÂçòÊï∞ÂΩ¢ÂæπÂ∫ï (Singular Form Issues)

No issues found - all target words correctly used in singular form.

### 4. ÁâπÊÆäÂêçË©û (Plurale Tantum)

### 6. ËªΩÂæÆ„Å™ÊîπÂñÑÁÇπ (Minor Improvements)

- **Problem**: Minor - could be more natural
- **Fix**: "The friendly German helped translate the menu."

**Row 4434**: `ms`
- **Original**: "Business correspondence uses Ms as a professional courtesy title."
- **Problem**: Using "Ms" as example feels meta/self-referential
