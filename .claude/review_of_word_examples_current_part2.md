**Scope**: Rows 2001-4000 of word_examples.csv (2000 entries reviewed)
**Quality Status**: Excellent - Minimal issues found after recent cleanup

## Issues Found

### 1. 品詞確認 (Part of Speech Issues)

**Row 2526**: `ready`
- **Original**: "Combat ready troops awaited deployment orders."
- **Problem**: 'ready' used as adjective modifying troops, not as noun
- **Meaning**: "Prepared for action; willing; available; in suitable condition"
- **Fix**: "The ready of the troops was evident in their swift response." (though this sounds awkward)
- **Alternative**: "The troops achieved readiness before deployment orders." (changes target word)

**Row 2527**: `real`
- **Original**: "Harsh real confronted idealistic young graduate."
- **Problem**: This usage is acceptable - "real" as noun meaning "reality"
- **Status**: ✅ Correct

**Row 2644**: `ride`
- **Original**: "Scenicyride revealed beautiful mountain landscapes."
- **Problem**: Typo - should be "Scenic ride" (space missing)
- **Fix**: "Scenic ride revealed beautiful mountain landscapes."

**Row 2999**: `still`
- **Original**: "Morning still reflected peaceful lake surface."
- **Problem**: This is correct noun usage - "still" meaning quietness/calmness
- **Status**: ✅ Correct

### 2. 文法・自然性 (Grammar and Naturalness)

**Row 3625**: `wrong`
- **Original**: "He could not tell right from wrong."
- **Problem**: This is correct noun usage - "wrong" as abstract noun
- **Status**: ✅ Correct

**Row 3970**: `ministry`
- **Original**: "Education ministry implemented new curriculum standards nationwide."
- **Problem**: Slight awkwardness - could be improved
- **Fix**: "The education ministry implemented new curriculum standards nationwide."

**Row 3999**: `neon`
- **Original**: "Neon is a chemical element used in bright signs."
- **Problem**: Redundant definition - example says same as meaning

### 3. 単数形徹底 (Singular Form Issues)

No issues found - all target words correctly used in singular form.

### 4. 特殊名詞 (Plurale Tantum)

- **Status**: 🔶 Special handling required - plurale tantum word

### 5. 内容適切性 (Content Issues)

**Row 2699**: `satan`
- **Original**: "Religious satan represented ultimate evil temptation."

- **Status**: 🔶 Content sensitivity

**Row 3578**: `wimp`

- **Problem**: Contains reference to bullying behavior
