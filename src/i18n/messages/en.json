      "title": "Why This Site?",
      "description": "Memorizing noun genders is one of the biggest barriers in studying German, French, Spanish, and other gendered languages.\n\nThe author, based in Japan where Japanese has no noun gender. However, was interested in this distant linguistic concept and created this tool for personal study at first.\n\nExisting learning tools had issues. They lacked information for languages like Hindi and Arabic. Most just provided lists without explaining why words have certain genders.\n\nThere was frustration that dramatic improvements were possible with better presentation. With my development knowledge and accelerated development speed through generative AI, this seemed achievable."
